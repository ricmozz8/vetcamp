# Vetcamp Front (Front end Side for the platform)
Implementation for the new platform.
## Requirements
It is important that you are not running any version higher than the `7.3.33` php version
since it will generate some compatibility errors.

### Installing the correct PHP Version
You may use the Chocolatey package manager for **Windows** to install the PHP Version
by using the following command:
```bash
choco install php --version=7.3
```

If you have a newer version you must allow the downgrade by using the following flag:
```bash
choco install php --version=7.3 --allow-downgrade
```
